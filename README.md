## Summary:<br>

Launching a bikeshare program in Des Moines, IA seems to be a sound business venture, if the bikeshare program in implemented in densely populated areas where parking is deficient and public transportation is widely used. Adding additional analysis is recommend:
* Comparing data from different month to determine trends across the year.
* Adding weather data to find correlation between weather and rides.
* Analyzing other cities that might be a better match to the size, population, and traffic pattern od Des Moines, IA.
